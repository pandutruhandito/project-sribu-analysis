# project-sribu-analysis
Sribu is an Indonesian online platform to connect people who need graphic design services and community of designers from all around the world.
I used this code to create my analysis in [my blogpost](http://pandutruhandito.tumblr.com/post/111245480179/how-designers-irrationality-and-inertia-make-up "How Designers’ Irrationality & Inertia Make Up @Sribudotcom’s Success").
More details about this project can be read in the link above.
